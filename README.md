  below for examples

Use `base` as an **easy way** to install the minimum essential libs/programs for
open-source exploration and development. Works for Linux (Debian and Fedora
based distros for now with more distros coming), Mac (includes installing
homebrew), and Windows (requires Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 to be setup
already with a Linux distro installed).

# About

When you source the `install.sh` script, your package manager will install
or update some packages, three symbolic links will be created in your
`$HOME` directory, and `~/commands.sh` will be auto-sourced at the end
(i.e. if using bash/zsh, the "shell functions" defined in `~/commands.sh` will
be "loaded" into your shell whenever you start a session, allowing you to call
any of those funcitons by name while using the terminal)

- `~/bin-base` -> /path/to/base/bin
    - directory containing some executable shell scripts
- `~/commands.fish` -> /path/to/base/commands.fish
    - file that can/should be sourced if using an interactive fish session
    - *only a small subset of what is available in commands.sh*
- `~/commands.sh` -> /path/to/base/commands.sh
    - file that can/should be sourced if using an interactive bash/zsh session
    - contains definitions of **many useful shell functions and aliases**

When you source `~/commands.sh` or `~/commands.fish` (directly or indirectly):

- GNU versions of `find`, `grep`, `sort`, and `xargs` will be used if they are
  installed on a Mac (over the default BSD versions)
- shell completions will be enabled for your installed versions of `git` and
  `docker`
- vi keybindings will be used for navigating/editing the command line
    - *i.e. hit <Esc> to enter "command mode" (to issue vi commands) and
      `i`/`I`/`a`/`A` to get back to "insert mode"*
- any shell functions defined inside can be called
    - *Note: most functions/aliases are conditionally defined, meaning that
      no assumptions are made about what programs are available to your
      system...*
        - if a shell func or alias makes use of a particular program and you
          don't have that program installed on your system, the func or alias
          will not be defined
        - if a shell func or alias requires using `sudo` (and you're not in
          the sudo/admin group, or the root user), the func or alias will not
          be defined
- the `~/bin-base` directory will be added to your `$PATH` environment variable,
  allowing you to invoke any of the scripts in there

# Install

### If `git` is available

```
% git clone https://github.com/kenjyco/base ~/repos/base

% cd ~/repos/base

% source ./install.sh extras
```

> Note: If you are in an interactive **fish shell**, do not source `install.sh`,
> but invoke either `bash ./install.sh` OR `zsh ./install.sh`

Near the end of process of running the `./install.sh` script, you will be
prompted to select your prompt type

```
Select prompt mode
1) verbose
2) terse
3) minimal
#?
```

> The verbose prompt includes the username, hostname, full path to the current
> working directory, and a newline for better visual separation. The terse
> prompt has the hostname and the name of the current working directory. The
> minimal prompt only has a single character and a newline. If you are unsure,
> select option 1 (verbose). You can try other prompt styles by running the
> `prompt-select-mode` command.

The `install.sh` script behaves differently if any of the following strings are
passed in:

- **`clean`**: ensures the git/docker completion files match installed versions
  (if packages were updated)
- **`extras`**: also installs non-essential, but light-weight CLI packages like
  `vim`, `tmux`, `tree`, `ncdu`, `glances`, `nnn` and more
- **`gui`**: also installs some light-weight GUI packges for Linux (including
  xorg-server, `awesome`, `rxvt-unicode`, `feh`, `scrot`, etc) or Mac (iTerm, vlc)
- **`all`**: clean extras gui

# Update

```
% base-update
```

> That command will `cd` to wherever you initially cloned this base repository,
> pull in the latest changes via `git`, and re-source the install.sh file.

# Usage

> Note: these shell functions and scripts are named for easy tab-complete
> (typing part of the command's name, then hitting the `<Tab>` key to fill in
> the rest, or `<Tab>` twice to show all the commands that match what was typed
> so far).

### Working with `repos-` commands

### The `grepit` commands

- **`grepit`**: recursively search current directory for matching lines (`-HnI
  --color -R` in use, as well as `--exclude` for many file extensions` and
  `--exclude-dir` for many directories); any options received get passed to `grep`
    - `-i pattern` to ignore case in search
    - `-E '(pattern1|pattern2|..)'` to match multiple patterns
    - `-B 1 -A 2 pattern` to show context lines (1 before match and 2 after)
    - `\bpattern\b` to only match when pattern is surrounded by a "word
      boundary" character (i.e. don't match a sub-string in a longer word)
- **`grepit-count`**: use `grepit` to show how many times pattern is matched in
  files (sorted by count and not showing zero matches)
- **`grepit-no-docs`**: use `grepit`, but also ignore txt/md/rst files
- **`grepit-no-docs-no-tests`**: also ignore test dirs
- **`grepit-py`**: similar to `grepit`, but only include .py files and ignore
  common directories
- **`grepit-py-no-tests`**: similar to `grepit-py`, but also exclude .py files
  in test directories

### The `grep` commands

- **`grep-object-info`**: recursively find usage of methods/attributes on the
  specified object, ordered by the number of occurrences
- **`grep-object-info-no-tests`**: same as grep-object-info, but does not search
  in test directories
- **`grep-history`**: search history files in `$HOME` for pattern
    - example: grep-history "git log [^-]"
- **`grep-history-exact`**: search history files in `$HOME` for pattern
- **`grep-history-comments`**: use `grep-history` to find entries that start
  with `#`

### The `example-usage` commands

> If you called `install.sh` to do setup and the `~/.base_path` file exists,
> several shell functions prefixed with `example-usage--` will be available.
> They all go to wherever the base repo is cloned, use `grepit` to find actual
> examples and usage patterns for certain things, then go back to wherever you
> were.

- **`example-usage--date-format-strings`**: show examples of some "format
  strings" passed to the `date` command
    - <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html> (jump to "FORMATS"
      section
    - <https://strftime.org>
- **`example-usage--substitutions-perl`**: show examples of using `perl` and
  "regular expressions" to modify output (that was piped to perl)
- **`example-usage--substitutions-sed`**: show examples of using `sed` and
  "regular expressions" to modify output (that was piped to sed)
- **`example-usage--test-regex-match`**: show examples of using `=~` in a shell
  conditional test to see if some text matches a "regular expression"
- **`example-usage--grepit`**: show examples of using `grepit`
- **`example-usage--findit`**: show examples of using `findit`
- **`example-usage--iterate-repos`**: show examples of iterating over repos
  (mostly using `repos-list` with `xargs`)
- **`example-usage--user-input-bash`**: show examples of using `read -p` to get
  user input when using bash (i.e. `[[ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]]`)
- **`example-usage--user-input-zsh`**: show examples of using `vared -p` to get
  user input when using zsh (i.e. `[[ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ]]`)
