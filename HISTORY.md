### Programming languages and text/stream editing tools

- 1957 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran>
    - general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language that is
      especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing
    - originally developed by IBM in 1957 for scientific and engineering
      applications
- 1966 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED_(text_editor)>
    - a line-oriented computer text editor that was developed by Butler Lampson
      and L. Peter Deutsch for the Berkeley Timesharing System
    - had a strong influence on the classic UNIX text editors ed, sed and their
      descendants such as ex and sam, and more distantly AWK and Perl
- 1968 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>
    - theorized in 1951
    - a sequence of characters that define a search pattern
    - used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace"
      operations on strings, or for input validation
    - programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via
      libraries
- 1969 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)>
    - a line editor for Unix and Unix-like operating systems
    - one of the first three key elements of the Unix operating
      system—assembler, editor, and shell—developed by Ken Thompson
    - many features of ed came from the qed text editor developed at Thompson's
      alma mater University of California, Berkeley
    - aspects of ed went on to influence ex, which in turn spawned vi
    - in current practice, ed is rarely used interactively, but does find use in
      some shell scripts
- 1969 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)>
    - B is a programming language developed at Bell Labs circa 1969. It is the
      work of Ken Thompson with Dennis Ritchie
    - was designed for recursive, non-numeric, machine-independent applications,
      such as system and language software
- 1972 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>
    - an imperative procedural language
    - designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to
      provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map
      efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support
    - C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972
      and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix
    - was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system
    - origin of C is closely tied to the development of the Unix operating
      system, originally implemented in assembly language
    - is available on various platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to
      supercomputers
- 1973 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)>
    - concept was invented by Douglas McIlroy when he noticed that much of the
      time command shells passed the output file from one program as input to
      another
    - ideas were implemented in 1973 when Ken Thompson added the pipe() system
      call and pipes to the shell and several utilities in Version 3 Unix
    - McIlroy also credits Thompson with the | notation, which greatly
      simplified the description of pipe syntax in Version 4
- 1974 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>
    - a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that
      match a regular expression
    - name comes from the ed command g/re/p (globally search a regular
      expression and print)
    - Before it was named, grep was a private utility written by Ken Thompson to
      search files
- 1974 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed>
    - a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact
      programming language
    - developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs
    - implemented many of the scripting features of qed that were not supported
      by ed on Unix
    - one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in
      use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command
    - alternative tools for plaintext string manipulation and "stream editing"
      include AWK and Perl
- 1976 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_(text_editor)>
    - a line editor for Unix systems originally written by Bill Joy
- 1976 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi>
    - a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating
      system
    - original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the visual mode
      for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck Haley
- 1977 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK>
    - designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and
      reporting tool

      scripting language to make report processing easier
    - borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script
      (sh), AWK, and sed
    - Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting
      language, in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string
      parsing abilities
    - Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance,
      bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been
      nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages" because of its

      modular software development
        - Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
        - Write programs to work together.
        - Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal
          interface.

    - initially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&T licensed Unix to
      outside parties in the late 1970s
    - Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes
      called the "Unix philosophy": the operating system provides a set of
      simple tools that each performs a limited, well-defined function, with
      a unified filesystem (the Unix filesystem) as the main means of
      communication,[3] and a shell scripting and command language (the Unix
      shell) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file>
    - Everything is a file describes one of the defining features of Unix, and
      its derivatives—that a wide range of input/output resources such as

      exposed through the filesystem name space
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs>
    - a special filesystem in Unix-like operating systems that presents
      information about processes and other system information in a hierarchical
