### Programming languages and text/stream editing tools

- 1957 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran>
    - general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language that is
      especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing
    - originally developed by IBM in 1957 for scientific and engineering
      applications
- 1966 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED_(text_editor)>
    - a line-oriented computer text editor that was developed by Butler Lampson
      and L. Peter Deutsch for the Berkeley Timesharing System
    - had a strong influence on the classic UNIX text editors ed, sed and their
      descendants such as ex and sam, and more distantly AWK and Perl
- **1968 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>**
    - theorized in 1951
    - a sequence of characters that define a search pattern
    - used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace"
      operations on strings, or for input validation
    - programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via
      libraries
- 1969 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)>
    - a line editor for Unix and Unix-like operating systems
    - one of the first three key elements of the Unix operating
      system—assembler, editor, and shell—developed by Ken Thompson
    - many features of ed came from the qed text editor developed at Thompson's
      alma mater University of California, Berkeley
    - aspects of ed went on to influence ex, which in turn spawned vi
    - in current practice, ed is rarely used interactively, but does find use in
      some shell scripts
- 1969 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)>
    - B is a programming language developed at Bell Labs circa 1969. It is the
      work of Ken Thompson with Dennis Ritchie
    - was designed for recursive, non-numeric, machine-independent applications,
      such as system and language software
- **1972 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>**
    - an imperative procedural language
    - designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to
      provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map
      efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support
    - C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972
      and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix
    - was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system
    - origin of C is closely tied to the development of the Unix operating
      system, originally implemented in assembly language
    - is available on various platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to
      supercomputers
- **1973 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)>**
    - concept was invented by Douglas McIlroy when he noticed that much of the
      time command shells passed the output file from one program as input to
      another
    - ideas were implemented in 1973 when Ken Thompson added the pipe() system
      call and pipes to the shell and several utilities in Version 3 Unix
    - McIlroy also credits Thompson with the | notation, which greatly
      simplified the description of pipe syntax in Version 4
- **1974 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep>**
    - a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that
      match a regular expression
    - name comes from the ed command g/re/p (globally search a regular
      expression and print)
    - Before it was named, grep was a private utility written by Ken Thompson to
      search files
- **1974 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed>**
    - a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact
      programming language
    - developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs
    - implemented many of the scripting features of qed that were not supported
      by ed on Unix
    - one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in
      use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command
    - alternative tools for plaintext string manipulation and "stream editing"
      include AWK and Perl
- **1976 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_(text_editor)>**
    - a line editor for Unix systems originally written by Bill Joy
- **1976 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi>**
    - a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating
      system
    - original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the visual mode
      for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with Chuck Haley
- **1977 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK>**
    - designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and
      reporting tool

      by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike
- 1981 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_(text_editor)>
    - a multi-file text editor based on structural regular expressions
    - originally designed in the early 1980s at Bell Labs by Rob Pike with the
      help of Ken Thompson and other Unix developers
    - interpreter's command set is modeled after the UNIX editor ed and may be
      used to operate the editor from a standard text terminal
- 80s <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)>
    - an imperative general-purpose programming language and programming
      environment

      (sh), AWK, and sed
    - Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting
      language, in part due to its unsurpassed regular expression and string
      parsing abilities
    - Perl 5 is used for system administration, network programming, finance,
      bioinformatics, and other applications, such as for GUIs. It has been
      nicknamed "the Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages" because of its
      flexibility and power, and also its ugliness

      provides common services for computer programs
    - time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the
      system
    - for hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the
      operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer
      hardware
    - operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer – from
      cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers
    - Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors;
      other specialized classes of operating systems, such as embedded and
      real-time systems, exist for many applications
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager>
    - a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing,
      upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's
      operating system in a consistent manner
    - deals with packages, distributions of software and data in archive files
    - packages contain metadata, such as the software's name, description of its
      purpose, version number, vendor, checksum (preferably a cryptographic hash
      function), and a list of dependencies necessary for the software to run
      properly
    - typically maintain a database of software dependencies and version
      information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code>
    - any collection of code, possibly with comments, written using a
      human-readable programming language, usually as plain text

      specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source
      code
    - often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code
      that can be executed by the computer
    - alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately
      executed
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software>**
    - a type of computer software in which source code is released under a
      license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study,
      change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose
    - open-source software development can bring in diverse perspectives beyond
      those of a single company
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>
    - computer software distributed under terms that allow users to run the
      software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute it
      and any adapted versions
    - free software is a matter of liberty, not price: users—individually or in
      cooperation with computer programmers—are free to do what they want with
      their copies of a free software (including profiting from them) regardless
      of how much is paid to obtain the program
    - computer programs are deemed free if they give users (not just the
      developer) ultimate control over the software and, subsequently, over
      their devices
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software>**
    - software that can be classified as both free software and open-source
      software
    - anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in
      any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are
      encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software
    - this is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under
      restrictive copyright licensing and the source code is usually hidden from
      the users
    - FOSS maintains the software user's civil liberty rights
    - Other benefits of using FOSS can include decreased software costs,
      increased security and stability, protecting privacy, education, and
      giving users more control over their own hardware

- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface>**
    - processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text
    - program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter
      or command-line processor
    - operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for
      interactive access to operating system functions or services
    - some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user
      interface and may still use a command line
    - programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via
      scripting
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion>**
    - a common feature of command-line interpreters, in which the program
      automatically fills in partially typed commands
    - allows the user to type the first few characters of a command, program, or
      filename, and press a completion key (normally <Tab>)
    - commonly accessed commands, especially ones with long names, require fewer
      keystrokes to reach
    - generally only works in interactive mode
    - name tab completion comes from the fact that command-line completion is
      often invoked by pressing the tab key
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)>**
    - a user interface for access to an operating system's services
    - it is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating

      outside parties in the late 1970s
    - Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes
      called the "Unix philosophy": the operating system provides a set of
      simple tools that each performs a limited, well-defined function, with
      a unified filesystem (the Unix filesystem) as the main means of
      communication,[3] and a shell scripting and command language (the Unix
      shell) to combine the tools to perform complex workflows
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution>**
    - an operating system made from a software collection that is based upon the
      Linux kernel and, often, a package management system
    - typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, GNU tools and
      libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (the most
      common being the X Window System), a window manager, and a desktop
      environment
    - most of the included software is free and open-source software made
      available both as compiled binaries and in source code form, allowing
      modifications to the original software
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution>
    - an operating system based on Research Unix, developed and distributed by
      the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of
      California, Berkeley
    - today, "BSD" often refers to its descendants, such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
      NetBSD, or DragonFly BSD, and systems based on those descendants
    - was initially called Berkeley Unix because it was based on the source code
      of the original Unix developed at Bell Labs
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)>
    - an open-source Unix-like operating system first released by Apple Inc. in
      2000
    - composed of code developed by Apple, as well as code derived from
      NeXTSTEP, BSD, Mach, and other free software projects
    - Darwin forms the core set of components upon which macOS, iOS, watchOS,
      tvOS, and iPadOS are based
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development>
    - the process by which open-source software, or similar software whose
      source code is publicly available, is developed by an open-source software
      project
    - open-source software development has been a large part of the creation of
      the World Wide Web as we know it, with Tim Berners-Lee contributing his
      HTML code development as the original platform upon which the internet is
      now built
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file>
    - Everything is a file describes one of the defining features of Unix, and
      its derivatives—that a wide range of input/output resources such as
      documents, directories, hard-drives, modems, keyboards, printers and even
      some inter-process and network communications are simple streams of bytes
      exposed through the filesystem name space
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs>**
    - a special filesystem in Unix-like operating systems that presents
      information about processes and other system information in a hierarchical
      file-like structure, providing a more convenient and standardized method
      for dynamically accessing process data held in the kernel than traditional
      tracing methods or direct access to kernel memory
    - mapped to a mount point named /proc at boot time. The proc file system
      acts as an interface to internal data structures in the kernel
    - provides a method of communication between kernel space and user space
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel>**
    - conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds
    - a free and open-source, monolithic, Unix-like operating system kernel
    - deployed on a wide variety of computing systems, from personal computers,
      mobile devices, mainframes, and supercomputer to embedded devices, such as
      routers, wireless access points, private branch exchanges, set-top boxes,
      FTA receivers, smart TVs, personal video recorders, and NAS appliances
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_interfaces>
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine>**
    - a virtualization module in the Linux kernel that allows the kernel to
      function as a hypervisor
    - was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 2.6.20, which
      was released on February 5, 2007
    - requires a processor with hardware virtualization extensions, such as
      Intel VT or AMD-V
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor>
    - computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual
      machines
    - a computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is
      called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine
    - presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and
      manages the execution of the guest operating systems
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization>**
    - an operating system paradigm in which the kernel allows the existence of
      multiple isolated user space instances
    - Such instances, called containers (LXC, Solaris containers, Docker), Zones
      (Solaris containers), virtual private servers (OpenVZ), partitions,
      virtual environments (VEs), virtual kernels (DragonFly BSD), or jails
      (FreeBSD jail or chroot jail), may look like real computers from the point
      of view of programs running in them
    - programs running inside of a container can only see the container's
      contents and devices assigned to the container
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs>
    - originally developed, starting in the late 1980s
    - team was initially led by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, Dave Presotto and Phil
      Winterbottom, with support from Dennis Ritchie as head of the Computing
      Techniques Research Department. Over the years, many notable developers
      have contributed to the project, including Brian Kernighan, Tom Duff, Doug
      McIlroy, Bjarne Stroustrup and Bruce Ellis
    - replaced Unix as Bell Labs's primary platform for operating systems
      research

- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git>**
    - a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code
      during software development
    - created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel
    - every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with
      complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of
      network access or a central server
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech>
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface>**
    - originally understood to be a computing interface specific to an
      application or operating system to allow third parties to extend its
      functionality beyond that which existed out of the box
    - now applies to the use of third party web services and sites as part of
      new application development
    - the "API" referred to is not intended to extend the functionality of the
      source website or service, but merely to use it
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computing)>
    - a sequence of data elements made available over time
    - can be thought of as items on a conveyor belt being processed one at a
      time rather than in large batches
    - normal functions cannot operate on streams as a whole, as they have
      potentially unlimited data
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol>
    - a communication protocol for electronic mail transmission
    - first defined in 1982
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite>**
    - the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the
      Internet and similar computer networks
    - commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite
      are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol
      (IP)
    - provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be
      packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received
    - technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its
      constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task
      Force (IETF)
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol>**
    - one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite
    - originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented
      the Internet Protocol (IP)
        - the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP
    - provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of
      octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an
      IP network
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol>**
    - the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for
      relaying datagrams across network boundaries
    - its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes
      the Internet
    - has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination
      host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography>**
    - a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys, which may be
      disseminated widely, and private keys,which are known only to the owner
    - generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on
      mathematical problems to produce one-way functions
    - effective security only requires keeping the private key private
    - any person can encrypt a message using the receiver's public key, but that
      encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell>**
    - a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely
      over an unsecured network
    - applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command
      execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH
    - provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client–server
      architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server
    - is generally used to access Unix-like operating systems
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>**
    - cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over
      a computer network
    - websites can use TLS to secure all communications between their servers
      and web browsers
    - aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more
      communicating computer applications
    - identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using
      public-key cryptography
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol>
    - a communications protocol that allows for the movement of data from one
      network to another
    - involves allowing private network communications to be sent across a
      public network (such as the Internet) through a process called
      encapsulation
    - involves repackaging the traffic data into a different form, perhaps with
      encryption as standard
    - can hide the nature of the traffic that is run through a tunnel
    - works by using the data portion of a packet (the payload) to carry the
      packets that actually provide the service
    - **Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel consists of an encrypted tunnel created through
      an SSH protocol connection**
        - users may set up SSH tunnels to transfer unencrypted traffic over a
          network through an encrypted channel
        - once an SSH connection has been established, the tunnel starts with
          SSH listening to a port on the remote or local host; any connections
          to it are forwarded to the specified address and port originating from
          the opposing (remote or local, as previously) hosta
        - SSH tunnels provide a means to bypass firewalls that prohibit certain
          Internet services – so long as a site allows outgoing connections
        - some SSH clients support dynamic port forwarding that allows the user
          to create a SOCKS 4/5 proxy
            - users can configure their applications to use their local SOCKS
              proxy server; this gives more flexibility than creating an SSH
              tunnel to a single port
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding>
    - an application of network address translation (NAT) that redirects a
      communication request from one address and port number combination to
      another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a
      router or firewall
    - port forwarding allows remote computers (for example, computers on the
      Internet) to connect to a specific computer or service within a private
      local-area network (LAN)
    - when configuring port forwarding, the network administrator sets aside one
      port number on the gateway for the exclusive use of communicating with a
      service in the private network, located on a specific host
    - external hosts must know this port number and the address of the gateway
      to communicate with the network-internal service
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS>
    - an Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and
      server through a proxy server
    - a SOCKS server proxies TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and
      provides a means for UDP packets to be forwarde
    - SOCKS performs at Layer 5 of the OSI model (the session layer, an
      intermediate layer between the presentation layer and the transport
      layer)
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy>
    - an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and
      authentication for data communication
    - used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files,
      directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of
      e-mail communications
    - developed by Phil Zimmermann in 1991
    - the Free Software Foundation has developed its own OpenPGP-compliant
      program called GNU Privacy Guard (abbreviated GnuPG or GPG)
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol>**
    - an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia
      information systems
    - HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where
      hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user
      can easily access
- **<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>**
    - a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be
      used for creating Web services
    - Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful
      Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the
      Internet
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII>

      character encoding standard for electronic communication
    - ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and
      other devices
    - ASCII was developed from telegraph code
